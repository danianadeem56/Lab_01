During Lab 01, I learned how to create files, add HTML content, and use Git for version control. 
I practiced creating branches, merging them, and tracking changes effectively. 
This lab helped me understand the workflow of committing, pushing, and managing project files in GitHub. 
I also learned how to use .gitignore and license files in a project.
